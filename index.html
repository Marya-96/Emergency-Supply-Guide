    <p></p><p><strong>Believe it or not but prepping can save you money (sometimes a lot) and should be integrated into your daily life.</strong> It's often too late to prepare right before disaster stricks. Prepping should be part of your day to day business.</p><p></p><p>Make sure to bring on-board your family (children, husband, spouse, partner, etc). <strong>However DO NOT advertise it to anyone else.</strong> You never know what people might do in desperate times.</p><p></p><p>It's also very important to rotate and eat your emergency stockpile in your daily life (many preppers and guide forget about this) For three reasons:</p><li>You don't waste food.</li><li>You don't waste your money and time.</li><li>You will know how to prepare food based on your emergency supplies. When disaster strikes, you won't be in unfamiliar territory. Simply doing what you already do on a daily basis. During emergencies it's a relief to not be completely disoriented.</li><p></p><p>Make sure to have some cash. Credit card and online banking network might be disrupted during emergencies.</p><p>  </p>

      <span class="fa-stack"><i class="fas fa-square fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fas fa-tint fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span>Water
    </h3>
    <p></p><p>Water is one of the most important aspect during crisis time.</p><p>A good rule of thumb: <strong>One gallon or 3 liters of water for each person in your familly per day for at least 5 days.</strong> The easiest and cheapest way is to simply get a bunch of water bottle and stockpile them.</p><p></p><p>You should rotate them every 6 months or so: Drink them or use them for coffee, cooking etc. Drinking water everyday is a good general advice. Sugar drinks and other soda and not versatile (you can't really cook or clean surfaces with a soda).</p><p></p><p><strong>Why not using a water tank?</strong> While water tanks can hold more water, you need to make sure the water inside stays clean (algee and fungy can quickly grow and can render it unsafe). This is possible but it is hard to do it right. The easiest is to go with bottles.</p><p></p><p>While not strictly water, its always useful to have:</p><li>Tea</li><li>Herbal Tea</li><li>Instant Coffee</li><li>Instant Chocolate</li><p></p><p>Those will help you to keep your moral and provide comfort during hard times.</p><p>  </p>

      <span class="fa-stack"><i class="fas fa-square fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fas fa-utensils fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span>Food
    </h3>
    <p></p><p>Stockpiling food is equally important, especially if you are under quarantine in your home.</p><h4>Dried food</h4><p></p><p>Dried food is easy to store of course depending on your preference you might want different dry food. An important rule is to only stockpile things you know you will eat. Because you will have to rotate them to not loose your food and your money this also insure your stockpile is always ready and fresh. As an example:</p><p></p><li>Rice</li><li>Sugar</li><li>Flour</li><li>Pasta</li><li>Lentils</li><li>Dried fruits</li><li>Cereals</li><li>Etc</li><p></p><p>If you want to go further:</p><p></p><li>Almond</li><li>Chestnuts</li><li>Dried mushrooms</li><li>Instant noodle (if you like them)</li><li>Raisins</li><li>Etc</li><p></p><p><strong>Do not store dried food in bags or cardbox, because bugs could get inside and trust me you don't want to see your emergency food rotten by worms.</strong></p><p></p><p>Hermetic reusable glass jars are amazing. First they will protect the food from bugs and other insects. They are transparent so by just looking at the shelf you will know how much is left and you can easily sterilize them. They can last a lifetime so it's a great investment.</p><p></p><p>Buy two medium sized jar for each dry food item you want to store. Why two medium? First it's easier to move them around (imagine moving a big rice jar) and when one is finished, let's say the rice one you can clean it and put it on a special shelf. At your next grocery shopping you will know what you need to buy (in this case rice). Not only you will never run out of stuff with this system but you can also save money by waiting when the food is on sale (I told you that prepping can save money on the long run).</p><p></p><h4>Canned food</h4><p></p><p>While it's possible to do your own canned food it's not recommended because if you don't know what you are doing it can create unsanitary conditions. Industrial canned food can last a long time.</p><p></p><li>Tuna</li><li>Tomate soup</li><li>Spam</li><li>Beans</li><li>Various canned vegetables</li><li>Fruit jam and marmelades</li><li>Etc</li><p></p><p>Again similar to dried food make sure you are doing rotations. Buy in sales to save money and replenish your stockpile.</p><p></p><h4>Ready to eat food</h4><p></p><p>You might not have access to a hot stove (no electricity or gas). It's always good to have ready to eat food like:</p><p></p><li>Beef jerky</li><li>Snacks</li><li>Cheese</li><li>Chocolate</li><li>Dried meat</li><li>MRE (if you can find them)</li><p>  </p>

Not only it is nicer and more relaxing to live in a clean home, you will make it easier if disinfecting is needed. As we learned in the food section, bugs and other worms can quickly degrade your food and make it unsafe to eat. Ideally because you rotate and use your stockpile everyday this should not happen.</p><p></p><li>Make sure smoke alarm are working.</li><li>Have a fire extinguisher ready</li><li>Keep all your rooms and corridor free of any junk.</li><li>Food and Chemical products should be stored in different places.</li><p>  </p>

Store batteries outside the radio and the flashlight if you don't use them. Batteries can leak over time and damage your emergency equipment.</li><li>Candles (be careful to not start a fire).

    </h3>
    <p></p><p> While you will not be able to be self sustainable with a garden in your balcony, making a small garden with vegetables can provide a few comfort food. This is also a cool project that helps coping with possible quarantine. If you know nothing about gardening, we recommend you to choose plants that grow in the climate / region where you live.</p><p></p><li>Onions (very easy to grow and resistant to most bugs and pest)</li><li>Mint</li><li>Lemongrass</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Chieves</li><li>Etc</li><p>  </p>

    <p></p><p>Prepping can be quite easy and save you money on the long run especially with dried food storage. The key is to start it and progressively build up. Don't forget to rotate your food and use from time to time your emergency gas stove to cook to make sure to know how to use it. <strong>Label all containers, food jars and your storage places so you can easily find stuff when needed.</strong> Print basic instructions and informations about the medications you need. Again without internet you might have to rely on those. Paper always works no matter what.</p><p></p><p><small>This document is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3.
